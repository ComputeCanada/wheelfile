class MetaData:
    """Implements Wheel Metadata format v2.1.

    Descriptions of parameters based on
    https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/. All parameters
    are keyword only. Attributes of objects of this class follow parameter
    names.

    All parameters except "name" and "version" are optional.

    Note
    ----
    Metadata-Version, the metadata format version specifier, is unchangable.
    Version "2.1" is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Primary identifier for the distribution that uses this metadata. Must
        start and end with a letter or number, and consists only of ASCII
        alphanumerics, hyphen, underscore, and period.

    version
        A string that contains PEP-440 compatible version identifier.

    summary
        A one-line sentence describing this distribution.

    description
        Longer text that describes this distribution in detail. Can be written
        using plaintext, reStructuredText, or Markdown (see
        "description_content_type" parameter below).

        The string given for this field should not include RFC 822 indentation
        followed by a "|" symbol. Newline characters are permitted

    description_content_type
        Defines content format of the text put in the "description" argument.
        The field value should follow the following structure:

            <type/subtype>; charset=<charset>[; <param_name>=<param value> ...]

        Valid type/subtype strings are:
            - text/plain
            - text/x-rst
            - text/markdown

        For charset parameter, the only legal value is UTF-8.

        For text/markdown, parameter "variant=<variant>" specifies variant of
        the markdown used. Currently recognized variants include "GFM" and
        "CommonMark".

        Examples:

            Description-Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=UTF-8; variant=GFM

            Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

    keywords
        List of search keywords for this distribution. Optionally a single
        string literal with keywords separated by commas.

        Note: despite the name being a plural noun, the specification defines
        this field as a single-use field. In this implementation however, the
        value of the attribute after instance initialization is a list of
        strings, and conversions to and from string follow the spec - they
        require a comma-separated list.

    classifiers
        List PEP-301 classification values for this distribution, optionally
        followed by a semicolon and an environmental marker.

        Example of a classifier:

            Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows :: Windows 10

    author
        Name and, optionally, contact information of the original author of the
        distribution.

    author_email
        Email address of the person specified in the "author" parameter. Format
        of this field must follow the format of RFC-822 "From:" header field.

    maintainer
        Name and, optionally, contact information of person currently
        maintaining the project to which this distribution belongs to.

        Ommit this parameter if the author and current maintainer is the same
        person.

    maintainer_email
        Email address of the person specified in the "maintainer" parameter.
        Format of this field must follow the format of RFC-822 "From:" header
        field.

        Ommit this parameter if the author and current maintainer is the same
        person.

    license
        Text of the license that covers this distribution. If license
        classifier is used, this parameter may be ommited or used to specify the
        particular version of the intended legal text.

    home_page
        URL of the home page for this distribution (project).

    download_url
        URL from which this distribution (in this version) can be downloaded.

    project_urls
        List of URLs with labels for them, in the following format:

            <label>, <url>

        The label must be at most 32 characters.

        Example of an item of this list:

            Repository, https://github.com/MrMino/wheelfile

    platforms
        List of strings that signify supported operating systems. Use only if
        an OS cannot be listed by using a classifier.

    supported_platforms
        In binary distributions list of strings, each defining an operating
        system and a CPU for which the distribution was compiled.

        Semantics of this field aren't formalized by metadata specifications.

    requires_python
        PEP-440 version identificator, that specifies the set Python language
        versions that this distribution is compatible with.

        Some package management tools (most notably pip) use the value of this
        field to filter out installation candidates.

        Example:

            ~=3.5,!=3.5.1,!=3.5.0

    requires_dists
        List of PEP-508 dependency specifiers (think line-split contents of
        requirements.txt).

    requires_externals
        List of system dependencies that this distribution requires.

        Each item is a string with a name of the dependency optionally followed
        by a version (in the same way items in "requires_dists") are specified.

        Each item may end with a semicolon followed by a PEP-496 environment
        markers.

    provides_extras
        List of names of optional features provided by a distribution. Used to
        specify which dependencies should be installed depending on which of
        these optional features are requested.

        For example, if you specified "network" and "ssh" as optional features,
        the following requirement specifier can be used in "requires_externals"
        list to indicate, that the "paramiko" dependency should only be
        installed when "ssh" feature is requested:

            paramiko; extra == "ssh"

        or

            paramiko[ssh]

        If a dependency is required by multiple features, the features can be
        specified in a square brackets, separated by commas:

            ipython[repl, jupyter_kernel]

        Specifying an optional feature without using it in "requires_externals"
        is considered invalid.

        Feature names "tests" and "doc" are reserved in their semantics. They
        can be used for dependencies of automated testing or documentation
        generation.

    provides_dists
        List of names of other distributions contained within this one. Each
        entry must follow the same format that entries in "requires_dists" list
        do.

        Different distributions may use a name that does not correspond to any
        particular project, to indicate a capability to provide a certain
        feature, e.g. "relational_db" may be used to say that a project
        provides relational database capabilities

    obsoletes_dists
        List of names of distributions obsoleted by installing this one,
        indicating that they should not coexist in a single environment with
        this one. Each entry must follow the same format that entries in
        "requires_dists" list do.

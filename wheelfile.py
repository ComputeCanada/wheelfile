class MetaData:
    """Implements Wheel Metadata format v2.1.

    Descriptions of parameters based on
    https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/. All parameters
    are keyword only. Attributes of objects of this class follow parameter
    names.

    All parameters except "name" and "version" are optional.

    Note
    ----
    Metadata-Version, the metadata format version specifier, is unchangable.
    Version "2.1" is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Primary identifier for the distribution that uses this metadata. Must
        start and end with a letter or number, and consists only of ASCII
        alphanumerics, hyphen, underscore, and period.

    version
        A string that contains PEP-440 compatible version identifier.

    summary
        A one-line sentence describing this distribution.

    description
        Longer text that describes this distribution in detail. Can be written
        using plaintext, reStructuredText, or Markdown (see
        "description_content_type" parameter below).

        The string given for this field should not include RFC 822 indentation
        followed by a "|" symbol. Newline characters are permitted

    description_content_type
        Defines content format of the text put in the "description" argument.
        The field value should follow the following structure:

            <type/subtype>; charset=<charset>[; <param_name>=<param value> ...]

        Valid type/subtype strings are:
            - text/plain
            - text/x-rst
            - text/markdown

        For charset parameter, the only legal value is UTF-8.

        For text/markdown, parameter "variant=<variant>" specifies variant of
        the markdown used. Currently recognized variants include "GFM" and
        "CommonMark".

        Examples:

            Description-Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=UTF-8; variant=GFM

            Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

    keywords
        List of search keywords for this distribution. Optionally a single
        string literal with keywords separated by commas.

        Note: despite the name being a plural noun, the specification defines
        this field as a single-use field. In this implementation however, the
        value of the attribute after instance initialization is a list of
        strings, and conversions to and from string follow the spec - they
        require a comma-separated list.

    classifiers
        List PEP-301 classification values for this distribution, optionally
        followed by a semicolon and an environmental marker.

        Example of a classifier:

            Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows :: Windows 10

    author
        Name and, optionally, contact information of the original author of the
        distribution.

    author_email
        Email address of the person specified in the "author" parameter. Format
        of this field must follow the format of RFC-822 "From:" header field.

    maintainer
        Name and, optionally, contact information of person currently
        maintaining the project to which this distribution belongs to.

        Omit this parameter if the author and current maintainer is the same
        person.

    maintainer_email
        Email address of the person specified in the "maintainer" parameter.
        Format of this field must follow the format of RFC-822 "From:" header
        field.

        Omit this parameter if the author and current maintainer is the same
        person.

    license
        Text of the license that covers this distribution. If license
        classifier is used, this parameter may be omitted or used to specify the
        particular version of the intended legal text.

    home_page
        URL of the home page for this distribution (project).

    download_url
        URL from which this distribution (in this version) can be downloaded.

    project_urls
        List of URLs with labels for them, in the following format:

            <label>, <url>

        The label must be at most 32 characters.

        Example of an item of this list:

            Repository, https://github.com/MrMino/wheelfile

    platforms
        List of strings that signify supported operating systems. Use only if
        an OS cannot be listed by using a classifier.

    supported_platforms
        In binary distributions list of strings, each defining an operating
        system and a CPU for which the distribution was compiled.

        Semantics of this field aren't formalized by metadata specifications.

    requires_python
        PEP-440 version identifier, that specifies the set Python language
        versions that this distribution is compatible with.

        Some package management tools (most notably pip) use the value of this
        field to filter out installation candidates.

        Example:

            ~=3.5,!=3.5.1,!=3.5.0

    requires_dists
        List of PEP-508 dependency specifiers (think line-split contents of
        requirements.txt).

    requires_externals
        List of system dependencies that this distribution requires.

        Each item is a string with a name of the dependency optionally followed
        by a version (in the same way items in "requires_dists") are specified.

        Each item may end with a semicolon followed by a PEP-496 environment
        markers.

    provides_extras
        List of names of optional features provided by a distribution. Used to
        specify which dependencies should be installed depending on which of
        these optional features are requested.

        For example, if you specified "network" and "ssh" as optional features,
        the following requirement specifier can be used in "requires_externals"
        list to indicate, that the "paramiko" dependency should only be
        installed when "ssh" feature is requested:

            paramiko; extra == "ssh"

        or

            paramiko[ssh]

        If a dependency is required by multiple features, the features can be
        specified in a square brackets, separated by commas:

            ipython[repl, jupyter_kernel]

        Specifying an optional feature without using it in "requires_externals"
        is considered invalid.

        Feature names "tests" and "doc" are reserved in their semantics. They
        can be used for dependencies of automated testing or documentation
        generation.

    provides_dists
        List of names of other distributions contained within this one. Each
        entry must follow the same format that entries in "requires_dists" list
        do.

        Different distributions may use a name that does not correspond to any
        particular project, to indicate a capability to provide a certain
        feature, e.g. "relational_db" may be used to say that a project
        provides relational database capabilities

    obsoletes_dists
        List of names of distributions obsoleted by installing this one,
        indicating that they should not coexist in a single environment with
        this one. Each entry must follow the same format that entries in
        "requires_dists" list do.

class WheelFile:
    """An archive that follows the wheel specification.

    Used to read, create, validate, or modify *.whl files.

    Attributes
    ----------
    filename : str
        Path to the file, if the instance was initialized with one, otherwise
        None.

    distname : str
        Name of the distribution (project). Either given to __init__()
        explicitly or inferred from its file_or_path argument.

    version : packaging.version.Version
        Version of the distribution. Either given to __init__() explicitly or
        inferred from its file_or_path argument.

    record : Optional[WheelRecord]
        Current state of .dist-info/RECORD file.

        When modifying other files in the archive, the record is written on
        each operation & on close().

        In lazy mode, this is only the case when using refresh_record() and
        write_record(), and if the file does not exist or is misformatted, this
        attribute becomes None. In such cases, calling refresh_record() creates
        it from scratch().

        In non-lazy modes, this file is always created/read & validated on
        initialization.

    metadata : Optional[MetaData]
        Current state of .dist-info/METADATA file.

        Follows the same semantics as 'record'. Values from 'distname' and
        'version' are used to provide required arguments when the file is
        created from scratch in by __init__().

        In standard modes, when changing data contained by the object this
        property returns, the file is being written only on close(). In order
        to write it beforehand, use write_metadata().

        When using lazy mode, the data is not being written to the archive on
        close().

    wheeldata : Optional[WheelData]
        Current state of .dist-info/WHEELDATA file.

        Follows the same semantics as 'metadata'. Consult docstring of
        WheelData class for the default values used.

        Use write_wheeldata() after editting it, in order to write it before
        close(), or - in lazy mode - to write the archive data at all.
    """
    # TODO: implement lazy mode
    # TODO: in lazy mode, log reading/missing metadata errors
    def __init__(
        self,
        file_or_path: Union[str, Path, BinaryIO],
        mode: str = 'r',

        version: Optional[Union[str, Version]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        """Open or create a wheel file.

        If lazy mode is not specified:
            - In read and append modes, the file is validated using validate().
            - In write and exclusive write modes, all .dist-info metadata files
            are created (see "Attributes" section of this class).

        To skip the validation for example if you wish to fix a misformated
        wheel, use lazy mode ('l' - see description of the "mode" parameter).

        In lazy mode, if the opened file does not contain WHEEL, METADATA, or
        RECORD (which is optional as per PEP-627), the attributes corresponding
        to the missing data structures will be set to None. In order to create
        them, either set these attributes yourself and call their respective
        write methods, or use fix().

        If any of the metadata files cannot be read due to a wrong format, they
        are considered missing.

        If the archive root contains a directory with a name ending with
        '.dist-info', it is considered to be _the_ metadata directory for the
        wheel, even if the given/inferred distname and version do not match its
        name.

        If the archive already contains either one of the aforementioned files,
        they are read, but are not checked for consistency. Use validate() to
        check whether there are errors, and fix() to fix them.

        There are currently 2 classes of errors which completely prevent a well
        formatted zip file from being read by this class:
            - Unknown/incorrect distribution name/version - when the naming
            scheme is violated in a way that prevents inferring these values
            and the user hasn't provided these values, or provided ones that
            do not conform to the specifications. In such case, the scope of
            functioning features of this class would be limited to that of a
            standard ZipFile, and is therefore unsupported.
            - When there are multiple .data or .dist-info directories. This
            would mean that the class would have to guess which are the genuine
            ones - and we refuse the temptation to do that (see "The Zen of
            Python").

        In other words, this class is liberal in what it accepts, but very
        conservative in what it does (A.K.A. the robustness principle).

        Note
        ----
        Despite all of this, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES being made as to whether a
        misformatted file can be read or fixed by this class, and even if it is
        currently, whether it will still be the case in the future versions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_or_path
            Path to the file to open/create or a file-like object to use.

        mode
            See zipfile.ZipFile docs for the list of available modes.

            In the read and append modes, the file given has to contain proper
            PKZIP-formatted data.

            Adding "l" to the mode string turns on the "lazy mode". This
            changes the behavior on initialization (see above), the behavior of
            close() (see its docstring for more info), makes the archive
            modifying methods refrain from refreshing the record & writing it
            to the archive.

            Lazy mode should only be used in cases where a misformatted wheels
            have to be read or fixed.

        distname
            Name of the distribution for this wheelfile.

            If omitted, the name will be inferred from the filename given in
            the path. If a file-like object is given instead of a path, it will
            be inferred from its "name" attribute.

            The class requires this information, as it's used to infer the name
            of the directory in the archive in which metadata should reside.

            This argument should be understood as an override for the values
            calculated from the object given in "file_or_path" argument.  It
            should only be necessary when a file is read from memory or has a
            misformatted name.

            Should be composed of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.

            See the description of "distname" attribute for more information.

        version
            Version of the distribution in this wheelfile. Follows the same
            semantics as "distname".

            The given value must be compliant with PEP-440 version identifier
            specification.

            See the description of "version" attribute for more information.

        Raises
        ------
        UnnamedDistribution
            Raised if the distname or version cannot be inferred from the
            given arguments.

            E.g. when the path does not contain the version, or the
            file-like object has no "name" attribute to get the filename from,
            and the information wasn't provided via other arguments.

        BadWheelFile
            Raised if the archive contains multiple '.dist-info' or '.data'
            directories.

        zipfile.BadZipFile
            If given file is not a proper zip.

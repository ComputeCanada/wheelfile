# Wheelfile âš™

This library tries to make it dead simple to create a format-compliant
[.whl file (wheel)](https://pythonwheels.com/). It aims to provide an API
comparable to [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html). Use
this if you wish to create wheels in your code.

For a quick look, see [example usage](example.py), which makes wheelfile
package itself into a wheel ðŸ¤¸.

#### What's the difference between this and [wheel](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/)?

"Wheel" tries to provide a reference implementation for the standard. It is used
by setuptools and has its own CLI, but no stable API. The goal of Wheelfile is
to provide a simple API.

## Ackonwledgements

Thanks to [Paul Moore](https://github.com/pfmoore) for providing
[his gist](https://gist.github.com/pfmoore/20f3654ca33f8b14f0fcb6dfa1a6b469)
of basic metadata parsing logic, which helped to avoid many foolish mistakes
in the initial implementation.

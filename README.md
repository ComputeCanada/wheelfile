# wheelfile

This library tries to make it dead simple to create a format-compliant
[Wheel](https://pythonwheels.com/). It aims to provide an API comparable to
[tarfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html) and
[zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html). Use this if you wish
to create wheels in your code.

#### What's the difference between this and [wheel](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/)?

Wheel tries to provide a reference implementation for the standard. It is used
by setuptools and has its own CLI, but no stable API. Wheelfile tries to
provide a simple API.
